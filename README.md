## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

These projects are built using the latest in Flutter and Dart, focusing on clean code, performance, and a great user experience.

- **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/):** The core framework for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.
- **[Dart](https://dart.dev/):** The powerful, object-oriented programming language that powers Flutter.
- **State Management:** (e.g., `setState`) for managing the app's state in a simple and efficient way.
- **Custom UI Widgets:** Building unique and custom user interfaces from scratch to match design requirements.
